.1 for a drone?
-.1 for anything other than a drone
-.1 for the queen sitting on things that are important
-.1 for the queen leaving the bottom two rows
-.25*(10/approxdist) for enemy proxy to workers or queen
.25*(10/approxdist) for worker proxy to food OR worker proxy to anthill, when carrying food
foodcount/11 'cus getting food's pretty great
